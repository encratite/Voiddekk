This is a turn based card game strongly influenced by Magic the Gathering.
My goal in this design was to eliminate all sources of randomness/non-determinism and also to avoid making single cards too powerful.

The game is played by two players who attempt to reduce the life of the other player to zero or less by using their cards wisely.
Each player enters the game with a deck of 40 cards in total.
The order of cards in this deck is chosen by the player but it cannot be changed once the game has started.
These cards may be any of the cards that are part of the game.
However, most of them are subject to certain limits in their number per deck.
A player's hand and their stacks are only visible to the owner.

Each player starts out with 20 life and and an initial hand of 6 cards, drawn from the top of the deck.
One player is given the first turn and may play their cards first.
The player's current hand and the stack stacks are concealed from their opponent.
Only cards from a player's current hand may be played.
At the beginning of each new turn (that is, not the first one) the active player must draw a card from one of the top 3 cards of their stack.
If the player's hand is empty and all stacks have been used up at this point, the player loses the game.
Stacks are likely structured such that the more expensive cards (i.e. they consume many resources) are closer to the bottom of each stack as they won't be of much use early in the game anyways.
The point of the 3 card rule is enabling players to counter their opponent in a more controlled way instead of being forced to draw cards in a purely one-dimensional manner.

Each turn consists of the following sequence of phases:

1. Main phase
2. Offensive phase
3. Defensive phase

During the main phase the current player may play any card that is not explicitly reserved for the defensive phase.
In the offensive phase the current player may declare their attackers.
The opponent may then choose to defend against these attacks using their units and defensive ability cards in the defensive phase.

These are the types of cards available:

1. Resource: makes new resources available for playing more cards whenever it's that player's turn
2. Unit: deploys a unit on the battlefield that can attack and inflict damage on the enemy player
3. Unit upgrade: grants bonuses and abilities to units
4. Ability: one-time use during main phase or defensive phase
5. Scientific progress: persistent global bonus for a player

Each player has certain resources that can be gradually built up with resource cards.
They can be consumed during both one's own turn and the opponent's turn.
They are only refreshed at the beginning of that player's turn.
Only one resource card may be played in a player's main phase.
That also immediately makes the resource available for the current turn.
The following overview provides a list of the resource types and their common uses, although these aren't absolutes.

1. Manpower
-used to produce infantry units
-component of upgrades for infantry units

2. Industry
-used to produce armoured units and air units
-component of upgrades for armoured units and air units

3. Technology
-special abilities
-component of advanced units
-component of upgrades

4. Command
-special abilities
-component of advanced units

Primary properties of units:

1. Type
2. Damage vs. ground units (integer)
3. Damage vs. air units (integer)
4. Life (integer)

Unit types:

1. Infantry
2. Armoured
3. Air

If damage is zero or less, this unit is unable to attack that particular unit type (ground/air).
If a unit's life is reduced to zero or less, it dies and is removed from the game.

Generic optional unit flags:

Cover: unit cannot be targeted by single target abilities, nor does it take damage from area of effect abilities
Fast recovery: unit is capable of attacking in one turn without going out of combat, it can defend in the next turn, whereas regular units would still be in recovery after the attack, without being able to defend
Infiltration: attacks by this unnit cannot be defended against
Overrun: remaining damage is applied to the opponent themself should the defenders blocking this unit all perish in the attack
Shock troops: unit deploys instantly and can perform combat actions the same turn its card was played instead of having a downtime of one turn
Suicide: this unit dies once it has performed an attack
