This is a turn-based strategy game played with cards, influenced by games like Magic the Gathering and Duel of Champions.
My goal in this design was to eliminate all sources of randomness/non-determinism and also to avoid making single cards too powerful.
However, I largely re-introduced at least deck randomness because it would likely make the game too static and make certain setups far too strong.

The game is played by two players who attempt to reduce the life of the other player to zero or less by using their cards wisely.
Each player chooses a pre-defined faction to play and enters the game with a deck of $deckSize cards in total.
The order of the cards in the deck is randomised at the start of the game, except for the top $fixedHandSize cards, which were chosen in advance by the player.
This causes the initial hand to be partially fixed and configurable by the player.
This way mulligans are no longer necessary as every initial hand is essentially useful.
The cards of a deck may be any of those associated with that faction.
Each one of these factions is associated with a race (i.e. a set of cards based on the same theme) and enables the use of a certain subset of the cards of that race.
They represent different flavours of the same race.
However, all of them are subject to certain limits in their number per deck.
A player's hand and their deck are only visible to the owner.

Each player starts out with $initialPlayerLife life and an initial hand of $initialHandSize cards, drawn from the top of the deck.
Once a player's life drops to $playerBleedingLifeThreshold or less, the player starts bleeding and loses $bleedingDamage health whenever it's that player's turn.
One player is given the first turn and may play their cards first.
Only cards from a player's current hand may be played.
At the beginning of each new turn (that is, not the first one) the active player must draw the top-most card from their deck.
If the player is unable to draw a card because they have run out of cards, they take $exhaustionDamage damage from exhaustion.
Players may only play cards during their own turn.

Types of cards available:

1. Unit: spawns a unit under your command

2. Attachment: permanently attached to a friendly or enemy unit, altering its behaviour

3. Ability: instant effect, must have one of the following targets:
Enemy unit
Friendly unit
Lane
Global

4. State: temporary effect, must have one of the following targets:
Lane
Global
Must have one of the following durations:
Until the next turn of the owner
Until triggered

The resource system is not based on playing resource-generating cards.
There is only one unified resource called resource points.
The number of resource points granted to a player depends on what turn it is and it is equal to $resourcePoints(turn).
This seemingly asymmetrical distribution is also an attempt at balancing out a first turn advantage.
Unused resource points carry over from the current turn to the next one only up $resourceCarryOverLimit so it is in a player's best interest to spend all of them each turn.
Players are also permitted to spend energy to draw additional cards fromn the top of their deck at the cost of $cardDrawingCost(draw).

The board is subdivided into two symmetrical sides, each one of which is assigned to one of the two players.
Each side features $laneCount lanes with $laneDepth positions each.
Each one of these positions may be occupied by up to one unit of that player.

A player may only have units from their faction or the neutral faction in their deck.
In general a unit may either attack or perform a move in a turn, not both.
A unit that was deployed in the current turn can usually not do anything in this turn.
A unit may be moved to any free position in any lane on the player's side of the board.
When a unit attacks, the target takes damage equal to the attack value of the unit.
Damage dealt to a unit is permanent.
Its life does not automatically recover at the end of a turn.
If attack is zero or less, this unit is unable to attack.
When a unit's life is reduced to zero or less, it dies and is removed from the board.
The target of an attack of a unit may be the player if the enemy's corresponding lane is empty.
Otherwise it must be an enemy unit that can be targeted by this unit.

A regular unit (i.e. a melee unit, but it's not a unit flag as it is the default type of unit) can only attack the first enemy unit in its lane.
If there is another friendly unit in front of it, it is considered "blocked" and its attack is temporarily reduced by one.
A ranged unit cannot be blocked and can target any enemy unit in the lane.
A flying unit cannot be blocked and can target any enemy unit in its lane or one of the two adjacent lanes.

Primary properties of units:

1. Name
2. Limit per deck
3. Resources
4. Damage
5. Life
6. Flags

Optional unit flags:

Armour(n): reduces the damage from attacks by units by n, does not reduce damage from abilities
Charge: attacks affect all enemy units in the lane
Entangle: immobilises enemy unit for one turn when dealing damage
Flying: does not suffer the damage penalty from being blocked, can target any enemy unit in its lane and the two adjacent lanes
Heal(n): heals up to n missing life on the friendly unit in front of it
Health link: all damage dealt to this unit is dealt to its owner aswell, healing effects work, too
Immune: immune to the effects of abilities used against it, cannot have attachments used on it
Initiative: able to perform an attack right after deployment
Life steal(n): this unit heals whenever it causes damage and the amount healed is equal to the damage dealt but cannot exceed n, healing does not mean it can gain more than its maximum life
Overrun: when an enemy unit is killed the remaining damage is applied to the unit behind it or, if there is no such unit, to the enemy player
Poison(n): when causing damage, the target will become poisoned for n turns, taking one damage from the poison at the beginning of each turn of the target's owner, poison damage does not stack, only the number of turns can be refreshed, the duration does not stack additively either
Ranged: does not suffer the damage penalty from being blocked, does not take defensive damage and can target any enemy unit in its lane
Reflect damage: reflects all damage dealt to this unit to the attacker
Regenerate(n): tregenerates n life at the beginning of every turn of its owner
Rush: can perform an attack after moving, but cannot attack and then move
Shield(n): can block up to n damage until the shield is destroyed, it regenerates at the beginning of every turn of its owner, can also block damage from abilities
Suicide: dies after performing one attack
Thorns(n): deals n damage to melee and flying attackers
Weaken(n): reduces the damage of a unit by n down to a minimum of 0 for one turn when dealing damage to an enemy unit
