This is a turn-based strategy game played with cards, influenced by games like Magic the Gathering and Duel of Champions.
My goal in this design was to eliminate all sources of randomness/non-determinism and also to avoid making single cards too powerful.

The game is played by two players who attempt to reduce the life of the other player to zero or less by using their cards wisely.
Each player chooses a faction to play and enters the game with a deck of $deckSize cards in total.
The order of cards in this deck is chosen by the player but it cannot be changed once the game has started.
These cards may be any of the cards that are part of the game.
However, all of them are subject to certain limits in their number per deck.
A player's hand and their stacks are only visible to the owner.

Each player starts out with $initialPlayerLife life and an initial hand of $initialHandSize cards, drawn from the top of the deck.
One player is given the first turn and may play their cards first.
The player's current hand and the stack stacks are concealed from their opponent.
Only cards from a player's current hand may be played.
At the beginning of each new turn (that is, not the first one) the active player must draw one of the top $drawDepth cards of their stack.
If the player is unable to draw a card because he has run out, he takes $suddenDeathDamage damage.
Stacks are likely structured such that the more expensive cards (i.e. they consume large amounts of resources) are closer to the bottom of each stack as they won't be of much use early in the game anyways.
The point of the drawing depth rule is enabling players to counter their opponent in a more controlled way instead of being forced to draw cards in a purely one-dimensional manner.
Players may only play cards during their own turn.

Types of cards available:

1. Unit: spawns a unit under your command
2. Ability: instant effect, one-time use
3. Attachment: permanently attached to a unit, altering its behaviour
4. State: global effect, lasts up to the current player's next turn

The resource system is not based on playing resource-generating cards.
Instead, a player has the choice of upgrading only up to one attribute per turn, independently of their hand.
These attributes determine what cards a player may play.
They are not resources themselves.
Once the attribute requirements of a card have been met, any number of them can be played, depending on the resources remaining for this turn and the cost of playing the card.
Each attribute has an initial value of 1.
The actual resource spent is a unified resource called action points.
The number of action points granted to a player depends on what turn it is.
They are equal to $actionPoints(turn).
This seemingly asymmetrical distribution is also an attempt at balancing out a first turn advantage.

Attributes:

1. Command: requirement for units
2. Skill: requirement for attachments and abilities pertaining to units/the opponent
3. Meta: requirement for states and abilities pertaining to deck control

A player may only have units from their faction or the neutral faction in their deck.
Damage dealt to a unit is permanent.
Its life does not automatically recover at the end of a turn.
If attack is zero or less, this unit is unable to attack.
If a unit's life is reduced to zero or less, it dies and is removed from the board.

Primary properties of units:

1. Faction
2. Limit
3. Attack (integer)
4. Defence (integer)
5. Life (integer)
6. Flags (optional)
